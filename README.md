This file was inspired by Josh Hug's "Analyzing Google Books Dataset" programming assignment located here:
http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/hug-google-books-dataset/

If you are not familiar with the Google books Ngram Viewer, what it does is allows you to see the relative frequency with which a
word or set of words appears over a given set of years. When we say relative frequency what we mean is the number of times a 
word appears relative to the total number of words that were published in any given year.

The first file generates a relatively simple plot of the relative frequency of any 3 words you input when you call a function.
